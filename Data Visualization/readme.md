## Dataset

It's a dataset for cyclists 
In the dataset we have a collection of rides
For each ride we have some information like 
start position , end position ,duration, customers or subscriber, gender , birthdate 



## Summary of Findings
Univariate

The most intersting findings that we have three separated areas in the dataset this was found by exploring the longtitdue and latitude 
we have the alot more subscriber than customers 
we have a lot more of males than females in the dataset
we have a lot of birthdates variates but the peak was arounf 1990
Most of the cyclists don't share the bike
most of the cyclists take the bike for around 1 k and the number decreses for more than this distance and less than it
I've generated the distance and noticed that there is some with zero distance which means that they have returned to the first point
	I called them turnaround cyclists most of them are subscriber
Like distance the duration peak was around 500 second and decreses for less and more than this

Bivariate

gender affection on duration is un-noticed all thre genders have quite the same mean 
the people who were born between 1985 to 1995 cycle for a duration more than others
customers duration ride are more than the subscribers
turnaround cyclists duration for customers and subscriber have alomst the same mean and have a lot of outliers
surely there is a corelation between duration and distance more distance = more duration(after removing the turnaround cyclists)
gender and user type doesn't have a lot of corelation
surely subscribion status is quite irrelavent to birthdate, just a lot more subscribers
surely subscribion status is quite irrelavent to gender, just a lot more males
surely bikeshare status is quite irrelavent to duration, almost the same mean

multivariate
area 0 have a lot more people spending time rides than the other two areas




  
  
## Key Insights for Presentation

I've explored almost all the features in the univariate and bivariate 
In the presentation I've shared the features and the visualization type then the visualization it self
